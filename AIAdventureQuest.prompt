Develop an interactive learning game called 'AI Adventure Quest' that educates users about AI agents and related subjects. The game should include quests, interactive tutorials, mini-games, quizzes, and practical coding challenges. It should use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js or Python for the backend, and AI libraries such as TensorFlow and NLTK. The game should feature progress tracking with a dashboard and reward system.
