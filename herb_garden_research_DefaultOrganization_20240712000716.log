In the garden.py file, I have implemented the `water_plants` method to iterate over all the plants in the garden and print a message indicating that each plant is being watered. I have also implemented the `harvest` method to return a copy of the plants in the garden and then clear the garden.

Please note that the implementation of the `water_plants` method currently only prints a message. You can modify it to perform the actual watering logic based on your requirements.

With these changes, the software is now fully implemented and ready to be used for growing a small herb garden indoors.

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the `tkinter` module and the `tkinter.simpledialog` and `tkinter.messagebox` submodules. These imports are required for the GUI functionality of the application.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, add the following import statements at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import simpledialog, messagebox
```

This will ensure that the necessary modules and submodules are imported and available for use in the code.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the `tkinter` module and the `tkinter.simpledialog` and `tkinter.messagebox` submodules. These imports are required for the GUI functionality of the application.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, add the following import statements at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import simpledialog, messagebox
```

This will ensure that the necessary modules and submodules are imported and available for use in the code."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statement for the `tkinter` module in the `garden.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to use the `tkinter` module in the `HerbGardenApp` class.

To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `garden.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This will ensure that the `tkinter` module is available for use in the `HerbGardenApp` class.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Research methods to grow a small herb garden indoors.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below:

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statement for the `tkinter` module in the `garden.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to use the `tkinter` module in the `HerbGardenApp` class.

To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `garden.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This will ensure that the `tkinter` module is available for use in the `HerbGardenApp` class."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
The code is missing the import statement for the `tkinter` module in the `garden.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to use the `tkinter` module in the `Garden` class.

To fix this, add the import statement for `tkinter` at the top of the `garden.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This will ensure that the `tkinter` module is available for use in the `Garden` class.
```
